# C++ Core Concepts Projects

This repository contains a collection of **C++ projects and utilities**
designed to demonstrate **core computer science concepts** through
practical, hands-on applications.

The projects are organized to clearly show my **learning progression**
from programming fundamentals to problem solving, data structures,
and object-oriented design.

---

## 📌 Basics & Programming Fundamentals
Console-based applications focusing on core C++ syntax, logic, and flow control.

- [Rock–Paper–Scissors](basics/rock-paper-scissors)
- [Math Quiz](basics/math-quiz)
- [ATM System](basics/atm-system)
- **Bank Extensions (Procedural Programming)**
  - [Extension 1](basics/Bank1)
  - [Extension 2](basics/Bank2)
  - [Extension 3](basics/bank3)

---

## 📌 Algorithms & Problem Solving
Reusable utility classes and namespaces that solve common programming problems
and demonstrate abstraction and clean logic design.

- Input Validation Utilities
- String Utilities
- Math Utilities
- Date Utilities

Each module is implemented using classes and namespaces and can be reused
across multiple projects.

---

## 📌 Data Structures
Implementations of fundamental data structures to strengthen
computer science foundations.

- Stack (Static & Dynamic)
- Queue
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

---

## 📌 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Full applications designed using object-oriented principles such as
encapsulation, abstraction, and responsibility separation.

- [Bank Management System](oop/bank-management-system)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is organized to reflect my **learning journey in C++**:

1. Programming fundamentals and procedural design  
2. Problem solving through reusable utilities  
3. Core data structures  
4. Object-oriented system design  

Each project or module has its own folder and README file explaining:
- The problem being solved
- The approach taken
- The concepts applied

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the desired project’s `.sln` file using **Visual Studio**  
3. Build the solution  
4. Run the program from the console
