# Math Quiz Game – C++ Console Application

A console-based math quiz game written in C++.
The program generates random math questions and evaluates the user’s answers
based on selected difficulty and operation type.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project using Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Run the program from the console
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- `enum` for difficulty levels and operations
- `struct` to store questions and quiz results
- Functions for modular program design
- Loops and conditional statements
- Randomization using `rand()` and `time()`

---
